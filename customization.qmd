```r
library(PKGNAME)
require(PKGNAME)
```

And if this R packages are available with CRAN and possible to install witn `install.packages`, `nhyris` will install them.

#### Default R packages

`nhyris` uses `shiny` and it's dependecy R packages.

#### How to utilize R packages from GitHub

`nhyris` uses [`pak`](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) to install R packages.
The CRAN packages will installed as example.

```r
pak::pak("ggplot2")
```

However, GitHub packages should mentioned as format of `REPO/PKGNAME`

```r
pak::pak("jcheng5/googleCharts")
```

to pass this information to `nhyris`, you should follow two steps

1. Add infomation in `pak-pkgs.R` in project.

```r
github_pkgs <- c(
    "jcheng5/googleCharts",
    ...
)
```

2. run `nhyris update PROJECT` command

and this will install GitHub R packages.


### Icon

`nhyris` uses nhyris logo, as icon of electron application.

<img src='images/app.png' width='70%'>

#### Where it should be located?

Image file for icon must exist in each project. For example(myapp), **myapp/icon.png** will used for electron application's icon in `out` directory.

::: {.callout-note}
In template, there's 3 example image file: `icon.png`, `icon.icns`, `icon.ico`

However, these are basically same file. (make `icon.png` and copy and renamed)
:::

In macOS, all of `png`, `icns`, `ico` will work.
but in official [guide](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/create-and-add-icons) of electron-forge, it's recommended to use
`icns` for mac, `ico` for windows, `png` for linux.

#### How to make custom icon file?

To make custom icon file in **macOS** you can use `nhyris.key` template file in repository. 

Modify image as you want ans export that page as Image (`png`).
