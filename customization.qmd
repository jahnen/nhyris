#### Where it should be located?

Image file for icon must exist in each project. For example(myapp), **myapp/icon.png** will used for electron application's icon in `out` directory.

::: {.callout-note}
In template, there's 3 example image file: `icon.png`, `icon.icns`, `icon.ico`

However, these are basically same file. (make `icon.png` and copy and renamed)
:::

In macOS, all of `png`, `icns`, `ico` will work.
but in official [guide](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/create-and-add-icons) of electron-forge, it's recommended to use
`icns` for mac, `ico` for windows, `png` for linux.

#### How to make custom icon file?

To make custom icon file in **macOS** you can use `nhyris.key` template file in repository. 

Modify image as you want ans export that page as Image (`png`).
