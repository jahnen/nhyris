title: "Why nhyris?"
---

`nhyris` (an anagram of `rshiny`, pronounced *nai-riss*) is a framework to transform R Shiny applications into standalone desktop apps.

This means **you can run a Shiny application using only a ZIP file**—no need to install R or RStudio.

### Why is this important?

R Shiny enables R developers to build interactive web applications with R.  
However, deploying Shiny apps typically requires engineering knowledge of **servers** and **infrastructure** to handle user interactions.

Many of Shiny’s target users—such as statisticians and decision makers—are non-technical and may lack the experience or desire to maintain Shiny servers.

Even for R developers, using Shiny apps can involve infrastructure complexity:  
- Ensuring offline access  
- Running in isolated environments  
- Handling data security and compliance

We propose building R Shiny applications in a completely independent and self-contained way, requiring **no external dependencies to run**—making building, running, and maintaining apps easier than ever.

This challenge affects R Shiny developers, organizations, SAS users transitioning to R, and academics—all of whom need self-contained, server-free Shiny applications accessible without technical setup.

The real-world adoption of R and Shiny in regulated and enterprise settings, as demonstrated by [Novo Nordisk](https://www.youtube.com/live/t33dS17QHuA?si=bQB4w_NCoi0XQBIj) and the [Submission Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/), highlights the growing need for seamless, accessible deployment solutions beyond academia.

### How do we solve this?

Previously, some attempted to build desktop applications using `Electron.js`, a popular framework for cross-platform apps. See this [showcase](https://www.electronjs.org/apps) for examples.

However, Electron is JavaScript-based, which can be challenging for R developers who are only familiar with R or Shiny.

A few years ago, we created a simple, reproducible process with step-by-step instructions ([see this repository](https://github.com/zarathucorp/shiny-electron-template-m1)), and it worked well.

### Why nhyris?

The previous approach focused on minimal applications and lacked guidance for advanced configuration, even though it was possible.

As an enhanced solution, **nhyris** expands beyond the original macOS prototype to support **Windows** and **Linux**, reduces deployment overhead, offers customizable design options, and provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials for R developers.

nhyris is designed as a CLI tool that generates a desktop application wrapper with a bundled R runtime for true standalone execution—no R or RStudio installation required.
