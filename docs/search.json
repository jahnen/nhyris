    "section": "",
    "text": "nhyris (an anagram of rshiny, pronounced nai-riss), is a framework for transform R shiny application into desktop standalone app.\nWhich mean, you can run shiny application, with only ZIP file (without R or Rstudio installed)\n\nWhy this is important?\nR shiny let R developer to build interactive web application with R. but as shiny, it requires dependency for engineering concepts like server & infrastructure to response user‚Äôs action interactively.\nSo, even one of main target user of R shiny is non-technical like Statisticans, or Decision maker. But they don‚Äôt have experience or don‚Äôt want to maintain R shiny.\nAlso, utilizing shiny application involves infrastructure complexity like offline access, run in separated environment, handle data security and complicance concerns even for R developer.\nTherefore we suggest as build R shiny application completely independent and self-contained way. Which doesn‚Äôt require any dependency to run (and build / maintain more easier than before)\n\nThis issue will affect to R shiny developers, organization users, SAS users transitioning to R, and academics, all of whom need self-contained, server-free shiny applications accessible without technical setup.\nAlso, Real-world adoption of R and Shiny in regulated and enterprise settings, as shown by Novo Nordisk and the Submission Working Group, highlights the growing need for seamless, accessible deployment solutions beyond academia.\n\n\nHow we solve this?\nPreviously, there was try to build application based on Electron.js, commonly used technique for building cross-platform application. See this link for showcase.\n\nHowever, electron is not R (but javascript), it also brings some challenge to R developer who only familliar with R or shiny.\nSince few years ago, we tried to make this process simple and reproducible with instructions. See this repository. and It worked well.\n\n\n\nWhy nhyris?\nPrevious trial was targeted to make most-minimal application, which doesn‚Äôt have guide about more detailed configuration even it has ability for do that.\nAs enhanced version, nhyris will expand beyond the macOS prototype to support Windows and Linux, reduce deployment overhead, offer customizable design options, and provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials for R developers.\nso it‚Äôs mainly designed as CLI tool, which generates application as a desktop wrapper, with a bundled R runtime for standalone execution.\n\n\n\n\nMade by jahnen"
